1. Introduction
This report summarizes the findings from the security assessment of the Chat & File Sharing Application. The goal of the assessment was to identify vulnerabilities and propose remediation strategies to improve the application's security posture.
2. Key Findings
The security testing of the application uncovered several critical and moderate vulnerabilities, including:
- Weak session management
- Insecure WebSocket (SignalR) implementation
- Application freezes during large file transfers due to slicing files in 16KB chunks
- SignalR vulnerabilities including acceptance of connections from custom Node.js clients
- Lack of session validation for SignalR connections
- Ability for attackers to join chats and invoke methods without restriction
- Chat messages not being persisted to the database
- RSA encryption size limitations
3. SignalR Vulnerabilities
The application uses SignalR for real-time messaging, which was found to have the following vulnerabilities:
- Connections from unauthorized Node.js clients are accepted
- Authentication is limited to token validation, with no session binding
- Attackers can join chat rooms and invoke backend methods directly
- Chat messages are not stored in the database, impacting auditability and reliability
- RSA encryption used has size limitations which could weaken security
4. Recommendations
The following recommendations are proposed to address the identified vulnerabilities:
- Bind session to a device fingerprint or IP address and validate it on the backend
- Require GitHub reauthentication before allowing access to chat or file sharing features
- Implement rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse of APIs
- Enhance logging and monitoring for all SignalR communications
- Save all chat data to the database for persistence and auditing purposes
- Upgrade RSA key sizes and review cryptographic best practices
5. Conclusion
The assessment highlights multiple areas where the security of the Chat & File Sharing Application can be significantly improved. By implementing the proposed recommendations, the overall integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application can be strengthened.
